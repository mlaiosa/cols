The       arguments      must       have        numeric   types.             With     mixed     operand   types,    the    coercion
rules     for            binary     arithmetic  operators apply.             For      int       and       long      int    operands, the
result    has            the        same        type      as                 the      operands  (after    coercion) unless the       second
argument  is             negative;  in          that      case,              all      arguments are       converted to     float     and    a
float     result         is         delivered.  For       example,           10**2    returns   100,      but       10**-2 returns
0.01.     (This          last       feature     was       added              in       Python    2.2.      In        Python 2.1       and    before, if
both      arguments      were       of          integer   types              and      the       second    argument  was    negative, an
exception was            raised.)   If          the       second             argument is        negative, the       third  argument
must      be             omitted.   If          z         is                 present, x         and       y         must   be        of     integer types, and y must
be        non-negative.  (This      restriction was       added              in       Python    2.2.      In        Python 2.1       and
before,   floating       3-argument pow()       returned  platform-dependent results  depending
on        floating-point rounding   accidents.)
